xv6 is a learning OS Kernel. It completely decribes the basic working of a UNIX based system.</br>
This is a reference guide for understanding and adding system calls. 
</br>
<a href="https://builtvisible.com/the-ubuntu-installation-guide/">Here</a> is a complete guide to install Ubuntu.</br>
To start off first we must have git on our laptops to clone the official repo of xv6 by MIT.</br>
Git install command:

  <b>sudo apt-get install git</b></br>

Commands to install qemu (an emulator) and cloning the xv6 repo:</br></br>
<b>
  sudo apt-get install qemu</br>
  sudo apt-get install libc6-dev:i386</br>
  git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git xv6</br>
  chmod 700 -R xv6</br>
</b></br>
Test whether xv6 is running by running the following:</br></br>
<b>
  cd xv6</br>
  make</br>
  make qemu</br>
</b></br>
Congragulations, you've successfully installed xv6 on your computer!
</br>
Now, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. 
A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.</br>

I have uploaded a zip file of my project after adding these system calls.
</br>
To run my project, download the zip file, extract and run the <b>make</b> commands given above.
</br>Enjoy!
